A program that allows user to choose their own team for each individual round within a limited budget, and compete against other users throughout the entire NFL season.
Points are collected based on the performance of the players themselves, the goal is to include in their team the players who will perform as well as possible for their NFL team in that round and thus bring the user points.
For each statistical category, there will be a formula that will calculate the total number of points for that player.
Each player will also have their own nominal Overall Rating so that the program has the most realistic simulations of matches and so that better players, especially starters and first string options, bring more points than backup players with smaller roles.
The higher the player's rating, the more expensive it is to include in your team. The program will also provide insight into some basic statistical categories for each team, for individual players, and ultimately for the entire league.
A simulation of the entire season will also be included so that the final standings of all teams at the end of the regular season can be seen.
